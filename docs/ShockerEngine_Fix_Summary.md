# ShockerEngine Rendering Fix Summary

## Problem
Objects were not rendering in ShockerEngine due to incorrect initialization order and missing pipeline configuration steps.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Material Setup Order**: The default material with hit groups was being created AFTER handlers were initialized, but geometry creation happens during handler initialization.

2. **Missing Pipeline-Scene Connection**: The pipelines were not being updated with the scene after building acceleration structures.

3. **SBT Generation Timing**: The shader binding table generation was happening without the proper scene-pipeline connection.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Reordered Initialization in `ShockerEngine::initialize()`
```cpp
// BEFORE: setupPipelines() was called after handler initialization
// AFTER: setupPipelines() is called FIRST to create default material with hit groups
setupPipelines();  // Creates defaultMaterial_ with hit groups

// Then initialize handlers
sceneHandler_ = ShockerSceneHandler::create(ctxPtr);
// ... other handlers ...

// Pass default material immediately
if (defaultMaterial_ && sceneHandler_) {
    sceneHandler_->setDefaultMaterial(defaultMaterial_);
}
```

### 2. Added Pipeline-Scene Connection After Building Acceleration Structures
```cpp
// In addGeometry() after buildAccelerationStructures()
if (gbufferPipeline_ && gbufferPipeline_->optixPipeline) {
    gbufferPipeline_->optixPipeline.setScene(scene_);
}
if (pathTracePipeline_ && pathTracePipeline_->optixPipeline) {
    pathTracePipeline_->optixPipeline.setScene(scene_);
}
```

### 3. Set Initial Scene on Pipelines in `setupPipelines()`
```cpp
// After generating SBT layout
if (gbufferPipeline_ && gbufferPipeline_->optixPipeline) {
    gbufferPipeline_->optixPipeline.setScene(scene_);
}
if (pathTracePipeline_ && pathTracePipeline_->optixPipeline) {
    pathTracePipeline_->optixPipeline.setScene(scene_);
}
```

## Key Insights from Working Sample

The working sample (`path_tracing_main.cpp`) revealed the critical sequence:

1. Create `optixDefaultMaterial` first (line 60)
2. Set hit groups on material (lines 127-129, 209-212)
3. Create geometry with this material (lines 889, 899)
4. After building AS, call `pipeline.setScene(scene.optixScene)` (lines 1715, 1726)
5. Then set hit group SBT (lines 1716-1717, 1727-1728)

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ Default material exists before any geometry is created
- ✅ Material has hit groups for all ray types
- ✅ Pipelines are connected to the scene after AS building
- ✅ SBT is properly updated with scene information

## Testing

After these fixes:
1. Build succeeded without errors
2. Material is properly passed to scene handler before geometry creation
3. Pipeline-scene connection is established at correct times
4. Proper logging added to verify material state

## Next Steps
1. Run unit tests to verify rendering works
2. Test with actual geometry to confirm objects render correctly
3. Monitor log output for material and traversable handle status
