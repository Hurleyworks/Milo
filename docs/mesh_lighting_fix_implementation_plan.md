# Mesh-Based Lighting System Fix Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan to fix the critical missing component in ClaudiaEngine's mesh-based lighting system. The `computeGeomInstProbBuffer` kernel is never called, breaking the middle level of the three-tier light sampling hierarchy.

## Problem Statement
- **Current Status:** The geometry instance level distribution computation is completely unimplemented
- **Impact:** System cannot properly select which geometry within an instance to sample from
- **Critical Gap:** `computeGeomInstProbabilities()` method exists but is never called
- **Result:** Non-functional for any scene with instances containing multiple geometries

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Understanding the Current Data Structure Relationships
**Goal:** Map out exactly how instances, geometry instances, and models relate in ClaudiaEngine

#### Tasks:
1. **Analyze the data model hierarchy:**
   - [ ] Study how `ClaudiaModel` relates to instances
   - [ ] Understand how geometry instances are tracked within a model
   - [ ] Identify where instance slots are assigned and stored
   - [ ] Determine how to get the list of geometry instances for a given model/instance

2. **Trace the data flow:**
   - [ ] Follow how geometry instances are created in `ClaudiaModelHandler::addCgModel()`
   - [ ] Understand how instances are registered in `ClaudiaSceneHandler`
   - [ ] Map the relationship between `ClaudiaModel` and instance slots in the instance buffer

3. **Identify missing connections:**
   - [ ] Determine if `ClaudiaModel` needs new methods to expose geometry instance information
   - [ ] Check if instance slot tracking exists or needs to be added
   - [ ] Verify how to map from a `ClaudiaModel` pointer to its instance data

**Deliverables:**
- Documentation of data structure relationships
- List of required new methods/fields
- Understanding of slot assignment mechanism

---

### Phase 2: Extending ClaudiaModel Interface
**Goal:** Add necessary methods to ClaudiaModel to support geometry instance distribution

#### Tasks:
1. **Add accessor methods to ClaudiaModel:**
   - [ ] Implement `uint32_t getInstanceSlot()` - retrieve which instance slot this model occupies
   - [ ] Implement `uint32_t getGeometryInstanceCount()` - get the number of geometry instances
   - [ ] Implement `std::vector<uint32_t> getGeometryInstanceSlots()` - get list of geometry instance slots
   - [ ] Consider adding `LightDistribution* getLightGeomInstDist()` - access the instance's light distribution

2. **Ensure proper slot tracking:**
   - [ ] Verify instance slots are assigned when instances are created
   - [ ] Ensure geometry instance slots are tracked when geometries are added
   - [ ] Make sure the mapping is maintained through the model lifecycle

**Deliverables:**
- Extended ClaudiaModel class with new methods
- Proper slot tracking implementation
- Unit tests for new methods

---

### Phase 3: Implementing the Missing Distribution Computation
**Goal:** Complete the `updateDirtyDistributions()` method with proper geometry instance handling

#### Tasks:
1. **Fix the updateDirtyDistributions loop:**
   ```cpp
   // Replace TODO comment at line 322-332 with:
   - [ ] Get instance slot from model
   - [ ] Get geometry instance count and slots
   - [ ] Call computeGeomInstProbabilities()
   - [ ] Add synchronization points
   ```

2. **Implement the CDF computation:**
   - [ ] Add stream synchronization after probability computation
   - [ ] Use CUB's DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum to compute the CDF
   - [ ] Call `finalizeLightDistribution()` to complete the distribution

3. **Handle the instance-to-geometry mapping:**
   - [ ] Ensure correct instance slot retrieval from model
   - [ ] Verify correct buffers are passed to kernel
   - [ ] Ensure distribution is stored in correct location

**Code locations to modify:**
- `ClaudiaAreaLightHandler::updateDirtyDistributions()` (lines 310-337)
- Potentially `ClaudiaAreaLightHandler::computeGeomInstProbabilities()` validation

**Deliverables:**
- Completed updateDirtyDistributions implementation
- Working geometry instance probability computation
- Proper CDF generation

---

### Phase 4: Synchronization and Memory Management
**Goal:** Ensure proper GPU synchronization and memory handling

#### Tasks:
1. **Add synchronization points:**
   - [ ] After kernel launches for probability computation
   - [ ] Before CDF computation
   - [ ] After distribution finalization
   - [ ] Before copying data between buffers

2. **Verify memory allocation:**
   - [ ] Ensure scratch memory is sufficient for all CDF computations
   - [ ] Check that distributions are properly initialized before use
   - [ ] Verify buffers are mapped/unmapped correctly
   - [ ] Validate buffer sizes match expected counts

**Critical synchronization locations:**
```cpp
// After computeGeomInstProbabilities()
CUDADRV_CHECK(cuStreamSynchronize(stream));

// Before DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum
CUDADRV_CHECK(cuStreamSynchronize(stream));

// After finalizeLightDistribution()
CUDADRV_CHECK(cuStreamSynchronize(stream));
```

**Deliverables:**
- Proper synchronization implementation
- Memory safety validation
- No race conditions or memory errors

---

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
**Goal:** Verify the fix works correctly

#### Tasks:
1. **Add debug output:**
   - [ ] Add printf in `computeGeomInstProbBuffer` kernel to confirm it's called
   - [ ] Log the number of geometry instances being processed
   - [ ] Output computed probabilities for verification
   - [ ] Add timing measurements for performance validation

2. **Create test scenarios:**
   - [ ] **Simple case:** Single instance with multiple geometry instances
   - [ ] **Complex case:** Multiple instances each with multiple geometries
   - [ ] **Edge case:** Instances with no emissive geometry
   - [ ] **Stress test:** Large scene with many instances

3. **Validation checks:**
   - [ ] Verify all three hierarchy levels are populated
   - [ ] Check distributions have non-zero integrals where expected
   - [ ] Ensure sampling chain works end-to-end
   - [ ] Validate against reference implementation output

**Test implementation:**
```cpp
// Add to compute_light_probs.cu
CUDA_DEVICE_KERNEL void computeGeomInstProbBuffer(...) {
    if (threadIdx.x == 0 && blockIdx.x == 0) {
        printf("computeGeomInstProbBuffer: CALLED! numGeomInsts=%u\n", numGeomInsts);
    }
    // ... rest of kernel
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- Test suite for geometry instance distributions
- Debug output confirming kernel execution
- Performance measurements
- Visual validation of rendered results

### Phase 6: Integration and Cleanup
**Goal:** Ensure the fix integrates properly with the rest of the system

#### Tasks:
1. **Update related systems:**
   - [ ] Ensure `ClaudiaSceneHandler` properly tracks emissive instances
   - [ ] Verify `ClaudiaModelHandler` correctly identifies emissive geometries
   - [ ] Check pipeline parameters are updated correctly
   - [ ] Validate integration with path tracing kernels

2. **Clean up temporary code:**
